### 🚀 Welcome to ProjectNinjaTech's GitHub Profile! 🚀

👋 Hi there! I'm **ProjectNinjaTech**, a passionate coder and tech enthusiast, and I'm excited to share my coding journey with you.

🌐 **Web Development:** I specialize in building web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and MySQL. You'll find a variety of web projects in my repositories, from simple static websites to dynamic web apps.

💡 **PNT Coding Platform:** In addition to my web development and server projects, I've developed the PNT (ProjectNinjaTech) coding platform. This platform is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and MySQL, and it integrates OpenAI API for AI-driven problem-solving. Some key features include:

- ✍️ **Code Editors**: PNT offers three code editors (CodeMirror, Ace.js, and Monaco Editor by Microsoft), each with its unique features. Some editors provide different themes, autocomplete, line numbers, and minimaps.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Solutions**: Each coding problem page features an AI icon above the code editor. Clicking this icon utilizes the OpenAI API to automatically generate solutions, providing users with invaluable assistance in problem-solving.
- ⚙️ **Admin Panel**: The platform includes an admin panel that allows administrators to upload, edit, or delete coding problems. Admins have full control over the problem content.
- 💳 **Profile Card**: Users have access to a beautifully designed profile card resembling a colored credit card. This card displays user details and allows users to update their information via the settings.
- 🖥️ **User Interface**: PNT boasts a minimalistic and visually appealing user interface. The login, registration, and problem list pages are designed with an interactive dark theme, ensuring an enjoyable user experience.
- 🏆 **Problem List**: The problem list page categorizes problems by difficulty and provides a solution icon. Clicking the icon redirects users to the corresponding YouTube solution page. Users can track their progress with a tick mark status indicator for solved problems.
- 📚 **Test Mode**: Users can test their coding skills with three difficulty levels: beginner, intermediate, and hard. Successfully completing a test grants users an autogenerated certificate of achievement.
- 🧪 **Interactive Testing**: The platform utilizes the Judge0 compiler by DigitalOcean to compile Java and Python code, enabling users to test and evaluate their code effectively.


📱 **Android Development:** I'm also skilled in Android app development using Android Studio and Java. I love creating mobile applications that solve real-world problems and provide delightful user experiences.

💻 **Scripting:** When it comes to scripting, Python is my go-to language. I enjoy automating tasks, working with data, and solving problems with Python scripts.

🖥️ **Server Deployment:** I have extensive experience deploying and managing a range of server applications, including:

- 📦 **Nextcloud**: For secure file storage and collaboration.
- 📺 **Media Servers**: Such as Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby for media streaming.
- 📂 **Samba Server**: For seamless file sharing.
- 📁 **FTP Server**: Enabling efficient file transfers.
- 🌐 **VPN Server**: Providing secure network access.
- 🌐 **CloudPanel**: Used for hosting WordPress and Node.js websites with ease.

☁️ **Cloud Platforms:** My server deployments extend to leading cloud platforms, including:

- ☁️ **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Leveraging AWS's robust infrastructure for scalable and reliable services.
- ☁️ **Oracle Cloud**: Utilizing Oracle Cloud's powerful cloud computing resources for various projects.

🎥 **YouTube Channel:** If you're interested in project-based coding tutorials and tech-related content, be sure to check out [ProjectNinjaTech on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProjectNinjaTech). I regularly upload videos where I walk you through the process of building exciting projects using the technologies mentioned above.
